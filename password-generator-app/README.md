## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- ChatGPT
- clipboard.writeText

### What I learned

- I used chat GPT for the first time so i could learn how to create iteractions using JS. I didn't know how to use the slider, checkboxes, link checkboxes with logic elements. So the tool helped me a lot, at the same time, the comments were generated and helped me to learn properly how this code works. I still need to implement a lot of new codes using these elements, so i'll be able to create muscle memory.
