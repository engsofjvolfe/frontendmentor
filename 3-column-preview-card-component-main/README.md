**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should:

- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- See the page here [Preview-Page](https://jvolfe-3-column-card.netlify.app/)
