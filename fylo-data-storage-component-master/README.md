## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, i use basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools i like to help me complete the challenge.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

See the page here [Preview-Page](https://jvolfe-fylo-datastorage-component.netlify.app/)

You can copy this repo, i left all folders and instructions here (except for this readme file, i changed it)
